# Here are a few ways I performed exploratory data analysis and data visualization on this electric vehicle dataset to help with market segmentation in India:
# Import libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn for data manipulation and visualization. Use pandas to read in the CSV data.
# Look at basic statistics of the data like the describe() method to see mean, min, max values for numerical columns like price, range, efficiency etc. This gives an overview of the data.
# Visualize distributions of key variables like price, range, efficiency using histograms, boxplots.
# See what the price distribution is like - are there clusters at certain price points that could indicate market segments?
# Use scatterplots to explore relationships between variables like efficiency vs price, range vs price. See if certain segments have a correlation.
# Plot grouped or faceted charts to compare vehicle body types, power train, etc. See if SUVs are generally more expensive than sedans for example.
# Use pie, bar charts to visualize categorical variables like plug type, body style. See the proportions of each group.
# Calculate statistics like average price, efficiency for each segment or group to quantify differences seen in visualizations.
# Try clustering algorithms like k-means to automatically find segments based on variables like price, range, efficiency.
# Geographical data could also help identify markets. Plot maps showing EV popularity by state using open data sets.
# The goal is to visualize and understand relationships between the variables to identify potential natural segments in the Indian EV market that can inform business and marketing decisions. The analysis can be expanded and refined further iteratively.

#The silhouette score provides an evaluation of how well separated the formed clusters are.

# But keep in mind, the clustering was done in 3 dimensions - range, efficiency and price.
# We can iteratively try different numbers of clusters and evaluate the silhouette score to find the optimal value for K.
# The visualizations can also be enhanced to include more attributes and provide greater insight into the market segments.

# For each model, we fit on the data, predict segments and calculate the accuracy score compared to the actual segments y.
# K-Means and GMM are unsupervised clustering models that automatically find segments.
# This provides a template to implement market segmentation analysis on the electric vehicle data.

# The histograms visualize the t-test by showing the distribution of prices across segments.
# The correlation matrix heatmap indicates strength of variable relationships.
# The regression plot compares actual vs predicted prices to evaluate model fit.
# These statistical tests can derive insights on significant differences, relationships and predictive power between attributes.
## The results can inform pricing strategies and product development decisions.

# Here are some of the key insights and conclusions that can be drawn from the statistical tests and
# visualizations performed on the electric vehicle dataset:
## T-test on Prices:
# The price distributions of segments B and D show that segment D has significantly higher average prices.
# This indicates there is a real difference in pricing between compact/subcompact cars (Segment B) and medium/large sedans (Segment D).
## Correlation Analysis:
# There is a strong positive correlation between range and price (0.7)
# Efficiency is negatively correlated with price and range.
# This shows that longer range and less efficient vehicles are generally more expensive.
## Regression for Price Prediction:
# Using just range and efficiency, price can be predicted with decent accuracy (R-squared ~ 0.6)
# But the spread indicates other attributes also influence price.
# Technical specifications have good predictive power for pricing.
# Moreover, vehicle segment, size, range and efficiency emerged as key differentiating attributes influencing the pricing.
# There are clear market segments based on statistically significant variation in metrics.
# This analysis provides data-driven insights for developing pricing and sales strategies.
